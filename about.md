Hi, I'm Jason. I am a data scientist currently working at Grow Financial Federal Credit Union where I work with R and Python to mine data for insights, generate machine learning / predictive analytics models, and build dashboards with Tableau and Rshiny. You can find my current work [here](https://github.com/jcrichardson617).

My adventures in data science began while obtaining my Ph.D. from the University of South Florida. During this time, I enjoyed working with data (modelling, coding, and doing research) more than the other parts of academia. I took as many stats courses as my department had available (and branched out to some others) while pursuing other aspects of data science.
