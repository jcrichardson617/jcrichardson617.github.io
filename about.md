Hi, I'm Jason. I am a data scientist with a passion for programming in Python and R, with experience in machine learning, data analytics, and data visualization. 

My adventures in data science began while obtaining my Ph.D. from the University of South Florida. During this time, I enjoyed working with data (modelling, coding, and doing research) more than the other parts of academia. I took as many stats courses as my department had available (and branched out to some others) while pursuing other aspects of data science. I am now looking to utilize my statistics and programming skills to bring actionable insights to your products by tapping into the potential of your company's data.
