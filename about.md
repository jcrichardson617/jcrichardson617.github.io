I am a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution from the University of South Florida. My dissertation examined the effects of gopher tortoise herbivory on plant community composition and how gut passage altered seed germination rates and percentages.

Prior to grad school, I had a bad case of mathophobia. When I took my first biometry course, I said to myself "this is where it counts" and made a concentrated effort to really understand the material. Turns out statistics is something I really enjoyed. I took as many stats courses as my department had available (and branched out to some others). I am now looking to utilize my statistics and programming skills to bring actionable insights to your products by tapping into the potential of your company's data.
