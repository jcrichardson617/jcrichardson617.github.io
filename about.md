My adventures in data science began while obtaining my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution from the University of South Florida. During this time, I enjoyed working with data (modelling, coding and doing research) more than I liked the other parts of academia (paper writing, grant writing). 

I took as many stats courses as my department had available (and branched out to some others) while pursuing other aspects of data science such as machine learning, deep learning, etc. I am now looking to utilize my statistics and programming skills to bring actionable insights to your products by tapping into the potential of your company's data.
