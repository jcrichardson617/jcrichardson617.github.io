Dear Buckethead,

First and foremost, I hope you enjoy Little Buckethead as much as I did making him. I have the artistic ability of an albino slug, so I apologize if I did not capture any element of you in all its glory. The guitar was my favorite and more proud part. I sculpted, shaved down, and painted the pickups, dials, and killswitches by hand out of air drying clay. The mask was clay as well. Was a great time making it, always nice to have a creative outlet. Sorry for not having nunchucks and foam fingers!

This is my third show (and tomorrow will be my fourth!) and you never fail to disappoint. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for having such an enjoyable performance each and every time. 

My intention of this message, and I hope you actually find your way here, is to replicate a letter I sent to the address listed on Bucketheadland.com, but I'm not sure if it's still active or you received it.

When I attended my first show in May of 2016, I met a guy named Rocky and his dad. Rocky's dad, I shit you not, looks just like Bernie Sanders, so we'll call him Bernie. Fast forward to May of 2018, my second show, Rocky and dad are back again too. Only this time...

Enter Crazy Lady. Crazy Lady was behind Bernie and Rocky, being obnoxious the whole time- smoking inside, trying to shove her way between them. During the show, she kept putting her hands through Bernie's arms, doing crazy "dances", touching his face. The culmination of her outlandish behavior was trying to choke out Bernie with the rope light, Rocky and I had to pry it out of her hands and off his neck. 

During crowd-killswitch-hammering time, I learned just what an awesome individual you are- you gave Bernie your pick. Now I don't know if it was because you saw Crazy Lady trying to ruin his night, but I like to believe it was so. You didn't miss a beat, and were still able to see something in the crowd, and did something to make sure a dedicated fan was still able to have a memorable night. Props to you my friend, keep on doing you.

I joked with Rocky and Bernie after that I hope a crazy person tries to choke me out next time, if you catch my drift! :)

Catch you in Tampa! And hopefully Rocky and Bernie as well.

PS I think the only song that I've not heard live that I really want to is "For Mom", do you take requests?
